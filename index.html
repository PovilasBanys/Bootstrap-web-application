            Comte would be stunned by the discoveries made since then. Today we
            know that the universe is far bigger and stranger than anyone
            suspected. Not only does it extend beyond the Milky Way to untold
            numbers of other galaxies—this would come as a surprise to
            astronomers of the 19th and early 20th century to whom our galaxy
            was “the universe”—but it is expanding faster every day. Now we can
            confidently trace cosmic history back 13.8 billion years to a moment
            only a billionth of a second after the big bang. Astronomers have
            pinned down our universe's expansion rate, the mean density of its
            main constituents, and other key numbers to a precision of 1 or 2
            percent.

          <p class="testimonial__text">
            Gravity, the force that revealed all that dark matter, has proved to
            be nearly as baffling. A pivotal moment came in 1915 when Albert
            Einstein published his general theory of relativity, which
            transcended Isaac Newton's mechanics and revealed that gravity is
            actually the deformation of the fabric of space and time. This new
            theory was slow to take hold. Even after it was shown to be correct
            by observations of a 1919 solar eclipse, many dismissed the theory
            as an interesting quirk—after all, Newton's laws were still good
            enough for calculating most things.

          <p class="testimonial__text">
            Measurements of this radiation have since enabled scientists to
            understand how galaxies emerged. Precise observations of the
            microwaves reveal that they are not completely uniform over the sky.
            Some patches are slightly hotter, others slightly cooler. The
            amplitude of these fluctuations is only one part in 100,000, but
            they are the seeds of today's cosmic structure. Any region of the
            expanding universe that started off slightly denser than average
            expanded less because it was subjected to extra gravity
